            I am very happy with this chair. The design is elegant and the
            height adjustment feature is easy to use (though I would love
            something with a bit more height range). It is well built and seems
            like it will be long lasting. Is it worth the cost? Not so sure
            about that. There are other equally beautiful and comfortable chairs
            out there that I suspect are as well made and sturdy as this one but
            lower in cost. I did not want Read More

            This chair is a disaster from start to finish. The design is far
            from elegantâ€”its bulky and awkward to fit into my space. The height
            adjustment feature is frustratingly difficult to use, and it doesnt
            offer enough range. It feels flimsy and cheap, and after just a few
            weeks, the chair started showing signs of wear and tear. The build
            quality is severely lacking, and I doubt it will last much longer.
            For the price, this chair is absolutely not worth it. There are far
            better options that are more durable, comfortable, and cheaper. I
            regret this purchase completely.
